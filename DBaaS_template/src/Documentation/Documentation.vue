            <div class="color4">8. Backup </div>
            <p>In BitBlast, backups refer to the process of creating copies of your databases on the DBaaS platform for
                safekeeping. These copies can be used to restore your database in case of data loss due to various
                reasons like hardware malfunctions, software errors, or even accidental deletions.</p>
            <div class="color5">Why Backups Matter</div>
            <p>In today's digital landscape, data is paramount. Safeguarding your databases is crucial to ensure
                business continuity and prevent potential data loss due to unforeseen circumstances like hardware
                failures, software errors, or even human mistakes. Regularly backing up your databases allows you to
                restore them quickly and efficiently, minimizing downtime and data loss.</p>
            <div class="color5">Introducing BitBlast Backups</div>
            <p>BitBlast empowers you to leverage two robust backup methods for your DBaaS deployments:</p>

            <p><b>Scheduled Backups:</b> Configure automated backups to run at predefined intervals, ensuring your
                databases are protected consistently. BitBlast will handle the entire backup process, storing your

            </p>
            <p><b>Manual Backups:</b> For added flexibility, you can initiate on-demand backups whenever needed. This
                provides an extra layer of control for situations where you require immediate backups for specific
                databases.</p>
            <div class="color5">Seamless Backup Management</div>
            <p>BitBlast offers a user-friendly interface for managing your backups. Here's an overview of the key
                features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Backup List:</b> View a comprehensive list of all your scheduled and manual backups. This list
                        will clearly indicate the database associated with each backup, the backup creation time, and
                        its status.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Backup Scheduling:</b> Define automated backup schedules for your databases. Specify the
                        desired frequency (e.g., daily, weekly) and retention period for backups. BitBlast will handle
                        the scheduled backups automatically.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Initiating Manual Backups:</b> With a few clicks, you can trigger a manual backup for any
                        database on your DBaaS platform. This provides flexibility for situations where immediate
                        backups are necessary.</p>

            <p>The Active Directory server in BitBlast serves as an authentication provider, streamlining the login
                process for users. Acting as a centralized identity management system, it allows users to access
                BitBlast using their existing Active Directory credentials.
                This integration simplifies user management by leveraging the authentication mechanisms already in place
                within the organization.</p>
            <p>By utilizing Active Directory as the authentication provider, BitBlast ensures secure access control and
                authentication protocols. Users can log in seamlessly, without the need for separate credentials or
                additional authentication steps. This integration enhances security measures by enforcing existing
                Active Directory policies, such as password complexity requirements and account lockout policies, across
                BitBlast access.</p>
            <p>Overall, the Active Directory server integration in BitBlast enhances
                security, simplifies user authentication, and improves administrative efficiency.</p>

            <p>You can log in to BitBlast using your Active Directory credentials, such as the username and password
                associated with your Active Directory server. This integration allows for seamless authentication,

            <div class="color4">5. User Management </div>
            <p>On the user management page, administrators have the flexibility to manage their users according to their
                preferences. In this, Admin have two options: 1) User Creation and 2) Auth Providers.

                users, all users, and Active Directory (AD) users. They can view a comprehensive list of all users and
                perform various actions.</p>

            <p> Moreover, administrators can view the Email Address associated with each user, facilitating
                communication and correspondence within the platform. For efficient user management, The Admin user can click the "Assign Roles" button 
                to assign roles to any user (Local user or Active Directory user). After assigning a role to a user, if the Admin wants to check which role has been 
                assigned to a user, the Admin can click the "Assign Role" button again to find out the assigned role. 
                This is because if a role is already assigned to a user, the checkbox for that role will be checked in the modal.</p>
                <img :src="require('@/Documentation/N-user-management-A.png')" class="custom-image"><br><br>  
            <p>In the User-Management section, under the user-creation option, there are two buttons: Create New User and Active Directory Groups.</p>
          

            <p><b>Create New User : </b>Want to add a new member to your team? The 'Create New User' button allows
                admin to seamlessly add a new user. Clicking on it opens a form where admin can input information such

                action activates the integration, allowing Active Directory users to access the BitBlast dashboard.
                Additionally, if needed, the admin can later click on the "Disable" button to revoke access for Active
                Directory users, thus preventing them from accessing the BitBlast dashboard.</p>
            <p>If the admin wishes to make changes to the Active Directory configuration, they can click on the "Add New Config" button
                to modify the settings in the Acitve Directory form. This flexibility enables admins to adjust the integration as
                necessary to meet their organization's requirements.</p>
            <img :src="require('@/Documentation/N-ad-save-config-A.png')" class="custom-image"><br><br>

            <p>When the Admin enables an Active Directory user through the Active Directory Form, they won't be able to access the Active Directory Form again. 
            Instead, they will see the Active Directory save configuration page until the Admin disables the Active Directory Enabled user.
             The Admin can only enable another Active Directory user once the previous Active Directory user has been disabled.
